    "Up to this point we have updated the weights of our models by manually mutating the Tensors holding learnable parameters (with torch.no_grad() or .data to avoid tracking history in autograd). This is not a huge burden for simple optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent, but in practice we often train neural networks using more sophisticated optimizers like AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam, etc.\n",
