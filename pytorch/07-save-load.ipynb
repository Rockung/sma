    "# Saving and Loading Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides solutions to a variety of use cases regarding the saving and loading of PyTorch models. Feel free to read the whole document, or just skip to the code you need for a desired use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to saving and loading models, there are three core functions to be familiar with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *torch.save*: Saves a serialized object to disk. This function uses Pythonâ€™s *pickle* utility for serialization. Models, tensors, and dictionaries of all kinds of objects can be saved using this function.\n",
    "2. *torch.load*: Uses pickle's unpickling facilities to deserialize pickled object files to memory. This function also facilitates the device to load the data into (see Saving & Loading Model Across Devices).\n",
    "2. *torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict*: Loads a model's parameter dictionary using a deserialized state_dict. For more information on state_dict, see What is a state_dict?"

    "\n",
    "A **state_dict** is simply a Python dictionary object that maps each layer to its parameter tensor in a model. Optimizer objects (torch.optim) also have a **state_dict**, which contains information about the optimizer's state, as well as the hyperparameters used. Note that only layers with learnable parameters(convolutional layers, linear layers, etc.) have entries in the model's state_dict.\n",

    "Because state_dict objects are Python dictionaries, they can be easily saved, updated, altered, and restored, adding a great deal of modularity to PyTorch models and optimizers."

    "When saving a model for inference, it is only necessary to save the trained model's learned parameters. Saving the model's state_dict with the torch.save() function will give you the most flexibility for restoring the model later, which is why it is the recommended method for saving models.\n",

Other items that you may want to save are the epoch you left off on, the latest recorded training loss, external torch.nn.Embedding layers, etc.\n",
