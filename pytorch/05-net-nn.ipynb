    "Computational graphs and autograd are a very powerful paradigm for defining complex operators and automatically taking derivatives; however for large neural networks raw autograd can be a bit too low-level.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building neural networks we frequently think of arranging the computation into layers, some of which have learnable parameters which will be optimized during learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, packages like Keras, TensorFlow-Slim, and TFLearn provide higher-level abstractions over raw computational graphs that are useful for building neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, the nn package serves this same purpose. The nn package defines a set of Modules, which are roughly equivalent to neural network layers. A Module receives input Tensors and computes output Tensors, but may also hold internal state such as Tensors containing learnable parameters. The nn package also defines a set of useful loss functions that are commonly used when training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we use the nn package to implement our two-layer network."
